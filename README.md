A repo for the tata sky recharge bot
---
Â Tl;DR
---
A simple tool for recharging your tata sky portal - i know its horribly written but its just a simple tool to save time from copying and pasting subscriber ID's.
Second Reason a very stupid attempt to name and shame tata over how poorly they have written their recharge portal for dealers, no re-captcha, no proper method for analytics and a horrible UI that bleeds my eyes (hope fully thats just me).

 
# long story
---
Yeah not much, anyway just want to diss on tata for their stupid way of writing a web app, and putting their employee names as comments in their final webpage. If this makes your day just feel happy to commit or ask questions.

# How to use
---
Just store all your customer subscriber ID's into a csv file, and edit the code to add your path. Add your Username and password in the variables as explained by the comments in the code, then just enter your customer name or what ever you have saved to identify a customer in the prompt when you run your code. After thats over refresh the account for the recharge to work. Wait patiently for the webdriver to load up, about 15-20 seconds on a fast internet connection for a recharge and a refresh seperately.

# Future Ideas
---
Probably add a gui and make the program more user friendly. Implement Keyring or encryption.
Improve code, thats it
